      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>
          At both Hydro Tasmania and Marinus Link, I’ve had to lead through some
          very challenging executive dynamics. My approach has always been
          grounded in kindness as clarity, and accountability as shared purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Hydro, I had an executive who was brilliant—sharp strategist,
          expert negotiator, great with large customers. But internally, he was
          competitive to a fault—hoarding information and undermining his peers.
          I didn’t confront him with blame. Instead, I gave him regular,
          in-the-moment praise for what he did well, and gently asked reflective
          questions like, “How would it feel if someone treated you this way?”
          or “What impact do you think that had on the team?”
        </p>
        <p>
          After a couple of months of these conversations, he came to me and
          said: "Caroline, I know what you want. But I’m a lone wolf. I work
          best on my own. What should we do?"
        </p>
        <p>
          We agreed on a six-month runway to resign. That created space for
          accountability without ego—he stayed on, passed on his negotiation
          skills to three colleagues, and left with his head high. I later
          brought him in as a contractor on Marinus Link—he delivered superbly,
          with no team conflict. That’s leadership for me: protecting the
          person, protecting the team, and protecting long-term value.
        </p>
        <div class="card-flex">
          <div class="card-width">
            <p>
              At Marinus Link, I had another exec who was deeply capable—technically
              brilliant and loyal to me—but a bully to others. I’d heard this from
              several people and knew I had to act. I had many conversations with
              her, asking, “How do you think you show up?” and gently holding up the
              mirror. She couldn’t see it. Eventually, she asked if she could resign
              and leave with dignity over three months. I agreed. She handed over
              responsibilities with care. Her behaviour improved. It was one of the
              hardest decisions I’ve made—because she was so good at the job. But
              culture matters. Kindness isn’t letting things slide. It’s being
              honest, fair, and brave.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kindness isn’t always a grand gesture. Often, it’s about being
              present, noticing what’s going on in people’s lives, and stepping
              in—quietly, meaningfully.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Hydro, I regularly made time for unscheduled conversations—stepping
              away from the office, walking with someone, really listening. One of
              our analysts—a single mum—was struggling during COVID. I asked a
              colleague to help me cook a meal and deliver it to her. It was one of
              the best dinners I’ve had. Today, she’s the Executive General Manager
              of Strategy at Hydro.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card-width">
            <p>That’s the impact of noticing.</p>
            <p>
              Kindness is also creating space for courage. I had several female
              graduates reach out to me about sexist behaviour they’d experienced in
              the Asset team. They didn’t want formal action. They just wanted
              someone to hear them, to validate their experience, and to create a
              circle of support. So that’s what we did. We met, we shared, we
              strategised. And slowly, confidence grew. They didn’t just feel
              heard—they felt equipped. I wanted to fight their battles—I was angry.
              But those young women showed me something deeper: strength in
              strategy, and humility in how power can be used.
            </p>
            <p>Kindness is making people feel seen. That’s where change begins.</p>

        <h3>Great teams aren’t just people grouped into a box on an org chart. They form when there’s clear purpose,
          clear expectations, strong leadership, and people willing to lean in.</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>
          At Marinus Link, I shifted our executive away from a focus on
          weaknesses—which had enabled some bullying behaviours—and toward one
          grounded in strengths.
        </p>
        <p>
          That shift changed the energy. People owned their work, held each
          other to account, and asked for help early—because they trusted the
          team would show up. Our exec meetings became less about holding people
          to task, and more about asking, “Who needs support to get this done?”
          And celebrating our successes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few months before I left, we held a strategy day with a senior
          advisor. At the end of the day, she said she couldn’t tell who held
          what title—CFO, COO, CCO, PD— because we were solving problems as one
          team. There was clarity, respect, and laughter. And only in that
          moment did I realise how rare that kind of executive cohesion really
          is.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Hydro Tasmania, there was no clear owner of long-term energy
          security for the state. I’m not exaggerating—there was simply a gap.
          With rainfall patterns shifting, customer growth rising, and new
          industries eyeing Tasmania, it was obvious the state would need more
          energy—and fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before there was certainty around Marinus Link, I pulled together a
          small cross- functional team to help government understand the scale
          and mix of future energy needs. We called it Project Echidna.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team came together through invitation—not instruction. A few key
          people from Commercial, Strategy, Legal and Comms put their hands up.
          We had a clear goal: deliver a compelling, evidence-based report to
          government by a fixed deadline.
        </p>
        <p>
          We ran daily 30-minute check-ins. Everyone knew what they owned, when
          it was due, and how their piece fit into the whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was one of the most rewarding team experiences many of us had. To
          this day, people still say to me, “That was so much fun working on
          Echidna.” A project born out of purpose, clarity and genuine
          collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Hydro Tasmania, we needed to meet the five-minute settlement
          requirements—quickly, within the constraints of being a government-
          owned business, and on a tight budget.
        </p>
        <div class="card-flex">
          <div class="card-width">
            <p>
              There was strong pressure to outsource. But I backed our internal
              team. We built a small, focused unit where business analysts and
              developers worked side by side, with a clear roadmap, firm milestones,
              and a team culture of trust and delivery. We delivered the system on
              time and under budget.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our independent auditor—PwC—said it was the best and most cost-
              effective solution they’d seen. They even asked to buy it. Great
              teams, with clarity and belief, deliver exceptional outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I joined Hydro Tasmania, the 24-hour spot trading and generation
              dispatch team had the lowest engagement scores in the business—down in
              the low 20s. I worked two consecutive night shifts with them to
              understand what was going on.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card-width">
            <p>
              What I found was a group that felt disconnected, underappreciated, and
              exposed—often working completely alone through the night. It had been
              that way for years, and no one questioned it. I did.
            </p>
            <p>
              I pushed—first with the CEO, then the board—for change. We moved from
              single-person shifts to having two people on at night. We introduced a
              proper rest space with fresh linen, and I expanded the team to create
              flexibility and resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most importantly, we brought them into the heart of the Commercial
              team—gave them a voice, visibility, and context. By the time I left,
              their engagement score had tripled, reaching into the 60s. Because
              when people feel seen, supported, part of a team and connected to
              purpose—they thrive.

        <h3>Doing the right thing— consistently— even when it’s difficult, unpopular, or behind closed doors. It’s the

          I don’t play games or hide behind spin. Whether I’m working with
          ministers, boards, or my team—I lead with openness and clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never use complexity to obscure risk, and I expect the same from my
          teams. People deserve to know what’s at stake—and why it matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Marinus Link, I inherited three misaligned governments, an
          ownership model built for conflict, and a global HVDC cable market
          running short on supply. The only way forward was trust—fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          I set up a Working Group with all three governments, CEFC, and their
          advisors. We ran 64 meetings in 12 months. We were transparent,
          deadline-driven, and honest about risk. We did what we said we would.
        </p>

              There won’t be a history book chapter on the decisions I made behind
              the scenes to get it built.
            </p>
            <p>
              But integrity is doing the right thing—even when no one’s watching.
              And I did. Every time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Days before securing a Capacity Reservation Agreement with Prysmian,
              the Tasmanian Government tabled in Parliament that it no longer
              supported Marinus Link and was “drawing a line in the sand.” It was a
              high-stakes moment. I didn’t react emotionally.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead, I researched the drivers behind the announcement, and calmly
              reassured Prysmian and Hitachi that the Commonwealth remained
              committed and would still underwrite the agreement—despite not yet
              being an owner of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              I called an all-staff town hall and was clear about what I knew, what
              I didn’t, and how we would move forward. Because of the trust the team
              had in me, tension defused. Confidence held.

          <div class="card-width">
            <p>Our engagement score, measured soon after, came in above 70.</p>
            <p>
              I created Australia’s first solar PPA not because it was trendy—but
              because it was viable, capital- efficient, and set a new standard for
              structuring clean energy deals for commercial customers

              Leadership in a crisis isn’t about certainty—it’s about composure,
              credibility, and connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              That consistency became our reputation—we were known as the team with
              integrity. It was a turning point. That trust was the foundation for
              making Marinus real.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marinus Link required courage at every step. It was never about
              headlines—it was about doing what was right, and delivering
              sustainable outcomes.

        <h3>My approach to engaging government stakeholders is grounded in transparency, understanding, and respect.
          These
          are the foundations for building trust— especially when navigating complex policy, regulatory and investment
          landscapes.</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>
          I focus on establishing open communication early, ensuring government
          stakeholders— both elected officials and senior public servants—feel
          respected, informed, and heard. Often, it's the relationships with
          senior departmental figures that enable momentum, clarity, and
          confidence in delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          I make it a priority to understand the drivers behind government
          thinking: policy objectives, political context, and community
          expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I frame my approach to align commercial outcomes with these
          imperatives—without compromising integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Hydro Tasmania, I attended energy cabinet meetings alongside the
          CEO, directly briefing the Premier and key ministers.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Marinus Link, I developed strong working relationships with senior
          figures in all three governments and CEFC—David Fredericks, Simon
          Duggan, Liz Molyneux (Victoria), Alistair Parker (Victoria)(will be
          referee), Craig Limkin (Tas), Mark Bowles (Tas) and Ian Learmonth
          (CEFC)
        </p>
        <p>
          I established a high-trust Working Group model that met 64 times in a
          single year. The group was respected for being reliable,
          well-prepared, and transparent—even when decisions were contested. I
          also built a team culture that encouraged trusted, direct
          relationships with government stakeholders. We understood when to
          inform, when to consult, and when to deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          I haven’t yet worked with the WA Government, I am confident in my
          ability to build rapport quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The principles—honesty, curiosity, and clarity—are universal. I would
          begin by understanding what matters most to WA leaders, then adapt our
          engagement style and narrative to reflect the State’s unique
          challenges and ambitions.

          I would like to explore a more impactful story telling message than
          the ‘energy transition.’
        </p>
        <p>
          Language and words are important. Something I have learned as CEO of
          Marinus Link is the frustration of the average person around what
          transition and transmission are and its importance and relevance and
          urgency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Global best practice isn’t something you admire from afar. It’s
          something you adapt, act on, and build coalitions around. That’s how I
          lead.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stay informed through curiosity and action. I don’t just read the
          reports—I build the relationships, lead the projects, and ask, “What
          would world-class look like in our context?”
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not one to shy from asking for help or seeking information from
          other energy businesses.

            <p>
              When looking to justify the spend on Marinus and accessing deep Hydro
              storage, I reached out to Snowy Hydro and asked for any of their
              modelling of the 2022 Energy Crisis, to support valuation of storage
              in times of crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an aside, deep and long duration storage should be measured and
              valued on an insurance type basis. A concept I have been sharing with
              all energy participants. This is a longer conversation on energy
              market reform around structure.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would regularly connect or have the team regularly connect with
              global OEMs, infrastructure investors and system operators to stay
              informed. Being informed can then lead to shaping of strategy. At
              Marinus Link we leaned on our Engineering contractor Jacobs to connect
              us with other global HVDC project teams. We met teams from Viking Link
              and the Champain Hudson Power Express.

          <div class="card-width">

              We mostly wanted to test our understanding of the tight cable and
              converter market to ensure we were not putting undue pressure on
              governments to act quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              After signing deals with Prysmian and Hitachi, we also kept informed on
              markets and changes through our relatioships with our suppliers.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Marinus Link, I built the business case for a multi-billion-dollar
              transmission asset in a fast-moving global HVDC market, aligning three
              governments and private suppliers on timing, value, and delivery
              certainty. That took more than knowledge—it took leadership under
              pressure, with clarity, composure, and conviction.

        <p>What I bring is a track record of unlocking progress—especially when traditional levers aren’t enough.</p>
        <p>
          At Hydro Tasmania, I repositioned deep storage as essential for a decarbonised NEM. 
          </p>
        </p>At Marinus Link, I created new commercial pathways - like Australia's first capacity reservation agreement - to overcome
        supply chain bottlenecks and move the project forward.
        </p>
        <p>At Synergy, I’d bring:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Flexibile thinking: Making the most of customer, grid, and
            market-side levers to smooth peak demand and firm supply.
          </li>
          <li>
            Capital innovation: Structuring long-term commercial models that
            attract investment and align with government priorities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Execution culture: Focusing on strategy that lives in the
            day-to-day, not just in presentations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          But there’s one frontier I believe we must start preparing for now:
         <b> climate adaptation<b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are unlikely to meet the 1.5–2°C target. That means we must start
          thinking beyond decarbonisation and begin preparing for operating
          energy systems in a hotter, more volatile world—systems with greater
          bushfire risk, water variability, load volatility, and equipment
          stress.
        </p>
           <p></em>
          Tapping in to Synergy's employees and finding the innovators is a skill I have.
          Entrepreneurial and innovative thinkers are attracted to other innovative thinkers.
          Creating the environment to explore is what I do best.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t yet have all the answers. But I know we need to start asking
          better questions— and Synergy should lead that conversation in WA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the answers to the energy transition will be
          technology-driven. But only if we think systemically—and act
          commercially.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kaluza, for example—a UK-based platform spun out of OVO Energy.
          It’s one of the most advanced orchestration systems I’ve seen. It
          intelligently manages 30,000+ EVs, optimising charging based on day-
          ahead pricing, capacity market signals, and system constraints. It
          doesn’t just respond to signals—it anticipates them. That’s the kind
          of adaptive technology thinking we’ll need at Synergy, especially in a
          constrained grid like WA’s. I met with the CEO Mel Gander last week to
          talk about what she is seeing in the market from a technology
          perspective.

          My vision for Synergy is to lead Western Australia through the

              the system actually needs.<br>
            <p>
              Platforms like Kaluza show what’s possible—using data and
              flexibility to optimise system outcomes in real time. To make this
              work in WA, Synergy may need to collaborate in ways it never has
              before—with partners, competitors, and adjacent
              industries—coordinating infrastructure, capability and timing to
              deliver grid-scale outcomes. That kind of leadership isn’t
              technical—it’s cultural.

              staged exits before—ensuring those involved walk out with pride
              and that culture isn’t left behind. The work is commercial—but the
              impact is human.

              I’ve lifted engagement, aligned exec teams, and driven performance
              by connecting people to purpose. That culture of
              accountability-with-care is exactly what sustains a

              WA’s system will face climate, technology and market shifts that
              aren’t yet fully priced in. My vision includes preparing for a

        <p>To Be Explored – Creative Capital Ideas for Synergy</p>
        <p>
          I am commercially minded,
          systems-focused, and not afraid to challenge the default settings.
          Some of these ideas would need rigorous testing and strong partners.
          But they’re the kinds of plays worth exploring if we want to unlock
          new value and lead, not follow.
        </p>
        <p><b>OEM-aligned financing.</b> At Marinus we had interest from OEMs on financing. It just didn't work with the CEFC structure.</p>
        <p>
          Invite key technology providers to co-invest or underwrite early-stage
          projects—tying their success to system performance, not just supply
          contracts.
        </p>
        <p> <b>Community co-investment. </b></p>
        <p>
          Use crowdfunding or “local energy shares” for community batteries or
          DER hubs—building public buy- in and unlocking capital through
          participation, not just procurement.
        </p>
        <p><b>Strategic start-up partnerships.</b></p>
        <p>
          Explore a small innovation fund to partner with WA-based energy or
          climate tech start-ups. It’s less about owning IP and more about
          seeing what’s next—and shaping it.

        <p><b>Securitising future flexibility.</b></p>
        <p>
          Could we monetise firming capacity, demand flexibility or

        <p><b>Strategic capital thinking. </b></p>
        <p>
          This isn't just project-by-project ROI.  It is about understanding where Synergy's capital
          unlocks the greatest value for WA - and how risk can be shared, commitments stage, or value amplified through partnerships.  
          The goal may not be to own everything.  There may be some ownership and some enabling the right things.
        </p>
        <p><b>Culture that drives value. </b></p>
        <p>
          Commercial discipline doesn’t start in finance. It starts in
          leadership. I build a culture where people move with clarity, pace, and purpose - where the "why"
          is just as clear as the "what".  That kind of alignment doesn't slow things down - it speeds them up.
        </p>
        <p><b>New revenue logic.</b></p>
        <p>
          Do we look at customers not just as payers, but as partners? What’s the
          value in firming? In orchestration? In time- shifting or resilience?
          There are services in this system that aren’t priced yet—but should
          be. 
        <li>At Hydro Tasmania, I helped shift the commercial mindset from
          selling megawatthours to selling value. That meant innovating around:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>FCAS hedging products (for those exposed to frequency risk)</li>
          <li>
            Virtual storage solutions—monetising dispatchable energy and meeting customers needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Market-leading firming contracts that traded reliability and
            flexibility as commercial instruments
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At Synergy, I’d be looking at where similar value exists today—or will
          exist soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can we monetise demand orchestration? Grid resilience? Or firming
          certainty? These services are essential— but not always priced. That’s
          the opportunity.
        </p>
        <p><b>Creative commercial structuring.</b></p>
        <p>
          I’ve delivered first-of-kind models—like Australia’s first behind the
          meter solar PPA and the capacity reservation deal for HVDC supply. The
          behind the meter solar worked as customers got a great deal, investors
          achiedved a great IRR. The capacity reservation deal worked because I knew what government
          needed to say yes to—and how to de- risk action without losing pace.
        </p>
        <p><b>What could be achieved in the first 12 months?</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Refocus leadership on enterprise outcomes</li>
          <p>
            Clarify the real commercial goals—what’s valuable now, what’s
            valuable later, and what’s noise.
          </p>

          <li>Pilot 1–2 innovative commercial models</li>

            program, or demand-side orchestration with OEMs.
            <li> The replacement and commercialisation will be lead by technology, this technology can be built
              internally and/or partnering with tech companies.</li>

          a “cheat sheet” of facts and figures I can refer to with confidence, 
          especially in high-pressure interviews or when there’s conflicting commentary in
          the media.  I don't read from these, but use as clarifying background notes
          for any interview, presentation or conference I speak at.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t just communicate data—I craft stories. People connect
          with stories. One of the more nuanced parts of my communications
          approach—especially at Marinus Link—was getting the narrative right
          for each audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          When speaking at a conference in Devonport, I’d anchor the message in
          Tasmania’s deep hydro legacy, referencing local history and the role
          the state played in powering early industry. In Gippsland, I’d draw on
          coal heritage and community resilience—how generations built and
          sustained the system that powered the state. It wasn’t always easy to
          get the Comms team to see that storytelling was strategy—but over
          time, they did.
        </p>

          <div class="card-width">
            <p>
              Alongside storytelling, I worked with the team to build a robust,
              scalable comms framework: collateral banks, scenario maps, ministerial
              briefings, escalation channels, and contingency plans for media and
              stakeholder engagement. With three governments overseeing Marinus
              Link, alignment and discipline were non- negotiable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Briefings for government were always clear, factual, and supported by
              internal experts—but delivered in my own voice, with or without the
              Chair depending on the need.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my proudest moments was leaving an ABC radio interview with
              Leon Compton, after a critical announcement. David O’Byrne, the former
              Opposition Leader, turned to me and said:
            </p>
            <p>
              “That’s the first time I’ve actually understood what Marinus does.”
            </p>
            <p>
              That moment proved to me that clarity isn’t just nice to have—it’s
              leadership.
            </p>
  
          </div>
          <div class="card-width">
            <p>Crisis management is where clarity and preparation matter most.</p>
            <p>
              At Hydro Tasmania, one of our major industrial customers threatened to
              leave the state—sparking a serious economic and political challenge.
              As a GBE, we had fiduciary duties to act commercially, while also
              fielding government pressure to compromise and managing intense
              stakeholder gamesmanship.
            </p>
            <p>
              We established a cross-functional crisis team that included comms,
              legal, risk and strategy. But most importantly, we gave government
              confidence. That meant bringing them into the process early, sharing
              structured plans, rehearsing scenarios, and making sure the story we
              told externally and internally held together. It wasn’t just managing
              the issue—it was leading through it.
            </p>
            <p> One of the most intense moments at Marinus Link came just days before we were
              due to sign the Capacity Reservation Agreement with Prysmian - our already cautious 
              international supplier. Remembering we were 100% owned by the Tasmanian Government 
              at the time.</p>
            <p>
              The Tasmanian Government unexpectedly tables a letter in Parliament that they had 
              sent to the Australian government declaring that Tasmania was 
              'drawing a line in the sand'
              and that Marinus was going to cost too much for Tasmanians.
            </p>

              <p>
              While it was clearly a politcal manoeuver to secure greater funding from the 
              Australian Government, it created immediate uncertainty for our suppliers,
              contractors and importantly my team.
            </p>

              <p>
              After talking to my Chair,
              I had to move fast - communicating calmly, clearly and with intent. 
              With the internal team and contractors I shared what I knew, what I didn't yet know 
              and how we were managing the situation.  That transparency helped maintain confidence
              and our engagment score was in the high 70's just weeks later.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                
              With suppliers, I provided context on state-federal dynamics and reassured them about the 
              strength of our project and partnerships.  It was a reminder that sometimes the work is 
              commercial but the terrain is political - and leadership is about steadying the ground 
              beneath people's feet.
              </p>
              </div>

        </div>
     <p>
      That’s how I show up in a crisis: prepared, principled, calm and clear.

        <p>
          Aligning Retail & Wholesale for Enterprise Success—Even with
          Structural Boundaries Retail and wholesale are often structurally and
          culturally distinct—and at Synergy, the wholesale business is
          ring-fenced by legislation. But that doesn’t mean they can’t be
          strategically aligned in service of the customer and the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Hydro Tasmania, I helped close the transfer pricing gap between
          wholesale and retail (Momentum), working closely with Amy Childs, MD
          of Momentum. We shifted from internal margin protection to enterprise
          value creation—anchored in what was best for the customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I’ll be honest—transfer pricing is always a point of tension,
          across sectors. As founder of a retailer, it was a regular
          conversation with our first investor, Darryl Flukes. These aren’t
          theoretical issues; they affect real customers—their prices,
          reliability, and trust.
        </p>
        <p>My approach:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with customer outcomes</li>
          <p>
            What do customers need: price certainty? reliability? green choice?
            Retail and wholesale should align around those needs—even if their
            mechanics differ.
          </p>
          <li>Respect the ring-fence—but unite on intent</li>
          <p>
            Structural separation doesn’t mean strategic fragmentation.
            Leadership must drive toward shared goals that deliver public and
            customer value.
          </p>
          <li>Create feedback loops</li>
          <p>
            Use retail customer insight—usage patterns, price sensitivities,
            preferences—to inform generation and firming strategies upstream.
          </p>
          <li>Design pricing and risk-sharing that reflects system value</li>
          <p>
            That means building contracts between retail and wholesale that
            recognise flexibility, time-shifting, and firming—not just energy
            volume.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This approach builds cohesion and commercial strength—but most
          importantly, it keeps the customer at the centre, even when parts of
          the business are structurally separated.

    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Balancing Commercial Priorities with a Values-Driven Culture</p>
        <p>
          For me, there’s no contradiction between strong commercial outcomes
          and a collaborative, values-led culture. In fact, I’ve found they
          reinforce each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve often worked in environments—like Marinus Link or Hydro
          Tasmania—where commercial performance had to align with government
          expectations and public trust. That’s where I draw on one of my
          favourite ideas: “long-term greedy”, coined by Goldman Sachs’ Gus
          Levy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It means doing your homework, keeping your word, honouring
          relationships, and always doing the right thing —even when no one is
          watching. That mindset balances short-term decisions with long-term
          integrity. It’s a commercial philosophy with values at the core.
        </p>
        <p>Real-world example: HVDC Cable Capacity Reservation Agreement</p>
        <p>
          When global supply chains were collapsing, I led the development of an
          entirely new commercial structure to secure HVDC cable and converter
          capacity for Marinus Link. We got three governments and CEFC aligned
          by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creating a transparent, shared-risk model</li>
          <li>Getting the Commonwealth to underwrite the reservation</li>
          <li>
            Giving suppliers certainty without locking the project prematurely
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It was capital efficient, aligned to stakeholder needs, and built
          long-term trust.
        </p>
        <p>Culture matters too</p>
        <p>
          I’ve never achieved strong commercial results without building culture
          first. At Marinus, I led with clarity, authenticity, and
          strengths-based leadership. As a result, we hit tight commercial
          milestones and lifted engagement—because people felt part of something
          real.
        </p>
        <p>
          Commercial outcomes follow when your people are aligned, empowered,
          and backed by a leader who knows when to hold the line—and when to
          walk beside them.
        </p>
        <p>Waste Reduction - Not Cost-Cutting but Unblocking Value</p>
        <p>
          I don’t come at value from a “cut costs” mindset. I focus on freeing
          up time, capital, and energy to reinvest in what really matters.
        </p>
        <p>That means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Automating the repeatable so talent can focus on the strategic, In a
            waste reduction program at Hydro, our C&I team programmed robots
            (AI) to fill in customer data, reducing error and human’s doing
            repetitive work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Removing friction—bureaucracy, unclear decision rights, siloed
            processes. Going back to strengths, clarity
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplifying complexity so people aren’t navigating red tape to
            deliver. I have found at Hydro and Marinus closed thinking and
            processes that don’t match the decade.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This isn’t austerity. It’s empowerment.</p>
        <p>And the real upside comes not from cutting—but from growing.</p>
